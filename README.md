# CSharp-Interfaces
This repository is used to store CSharp interfaces programs

What is an Interface:
An terface contains definitions of a group of related functionalities that a non abstract class or struct must implement

So basically it is a contact :
 "I have these functions"
 &
 Functions have Properties, methods,events, indexers
 
 Lets take an Example of a Regular polygon
 
  It has 3 or more sides, each side of the same length
  
  Example are a Square and Triangle 
  
  Take Perimeter : its the distance around the shape
  
  Permieter = sides * length
   Its formula is same for every polygon
   
  Area: This is the space inside the shape
  
  Area = length * length ( this is for a Square)
  but in case of a Equilateral triangle , Area = length * length * sqrt(3)/4
  
  So calculation of the area varies based on Polygon
  
 
 Lets represent the Regular Polygon as a 
 
 1. Concrete Class
 2. Abstract class
 3. Interface
